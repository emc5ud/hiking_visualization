# hiking_visualization
This project was meant to be a soft introduction to the world of GIS. From this project I learned about various file formats, such as [LAS files](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/las-dataset/what-is-a-las-dataset-.htm) used to store Lidar point data, gpx files meant to store gps data, and .vrt files which can store digital elevation data. 

## Resources Used

So far, this project was done entirely using software and data available online for free. [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) was especially useful, as it provided both high res lidar data and 1 arcsec digital elevation data. Although I did not end up using the lidar data in the final project, learning the intricacies of lidar to digital converstion using both [pointcloudviz](http://www.pointcloudviz.com/) and [lastools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/)

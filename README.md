# hiking_visualization
This project was meant to be a soft introduction to the world of GIS. From this project I learned about various file formats, such as [LAS files](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/las-dataset/what-is-a-las-dataset-.htm) used to store Lidar point data, gpx files meant to store gps data, and .vrt files which can store digital elevation data. 

## Resources Used

So far, this project was done entirely using software and data available online for free. [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) was especially useful, as it provided both high res lidar data and 1 arcsec digital elevation data. Although I did not end up using the lidar data in the final project, learning the intricacies of lidar to digital converstion using both [pointcloudviz](http://www.pointcloudviz.com/) and [lastools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/) was instructive. Both [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) and the plugin [qgis2threejs](https://github.com/minorua/Qgis2threejs) were instrumental to this project. Also, shoutout to [gpslogger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger&hl=en) for being a simple lightweight app that works well.
